    """
    Retrieve similar chunks for a given query with security filtering.
    
    Args:
        query: User query text
        top_k: Number of results to return from vector search
        organization_id: Organization ID for multi-tenant isolation
        min_score: Cosine distance threshold (uses config default if None)
        
    Returns:
        List of similar chunks with text, metadata, and cosine distance scores
        Only returns chunks that meet the similarity threshold (score <= min_score)
        
    Score Semantics:
        - Scores represent cosine distance (0.0 = identical, 2.0 = opposite)
        - Lower scores indicate MORE similarity
        - min_score is the maximum acceptable distance
        - Default threshold (0.5) filters moderately similar and better chunks
        
    Security:
        - Filters results by cosine distance to prevent irrelevant context
        - Enforces organization boundaries for multi-tenant isolation
        - Returns empty list if no chunks meet threshold
        
    Example:
        Query: "What is FastAPI?"
        Results before filtering:
        - Chunk 1: score=0.15 (highly similar) → KEPT
        - Chunk 2: score=0.42 (moderately similar) → KEPT
        - Chunk 3: score=0.68 (loosely related) → FILTERED OUT
